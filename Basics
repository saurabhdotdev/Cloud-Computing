***Concepts***
1)Virtualization
Turning one physical server into many virtual servers.
Regions and Availability Zones
Region = geographic location (e.g., Mumbai)
Availability Zone (AZ) = data centers inside a region
More AZs = better reliability.

2) Auto Scaling
Automatically increases/decreases servers based on traffic.

3) Load Balancer
Distributes incoming traffic to multiple servers.

4) Serverless
Write code without managing servers.
Examples: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions.


***Cloud Storage Types***
1)Object Storage
Stores data as objects (images, videos, backups).
Example: AWS S3.
Highly scalable + cheap.

2)Block Storage
Used for VMs (like hard drives).
Example: AWS EBS.

3)File Storage
Shared file systems.
Example: AWS EFS.
